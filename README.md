### Hi there, I'm Abu Musa
#### Web Developer

I'm Front End Developer who is passionate about making error-free websites with client satisfaction. I have a passion for learning a new thing and sharing it. I love to solve real-world problems. Over the past years, I created

Most of the time I worked on React.js with Redux / ContextAPI, Next.js, React Native, MaterialUI, Sass, Bootstrap, Firebase but some technology I really enjoy working with PSD TO HTML and Vanilla JavaScript

Skills: REACT.JS / REACT NATIVE / NEXT.JS/ REDUX / FIREBASE /  JS / HTML / CSS / SASS / MATERIAL-UI
